Test Reddit Microservice
========================

This service does not currently do anything very useful and is more set up to experiment with 
[Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).

Usage
-----

Run application with command argument ```--secret='API_SECRET'```.
 
If you do not have a API id and secret follow instructions found on the 
[Reddit OAuth page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2). After plugging these into application.properties
and or the command line argument. Run the application and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in the browser
to continue following the instructions.
